# Client Task C #
# Add your pseudocode to this file below this line: #
# ------------------------------------------------- #

- create 2 variables: itemCount, and targetNum. itemCount will be assigned 0, and targetNum will be assigned 50.

- When the first product is scanned:
    - Start a loop that continually checks to see if itemCount and targetNum is the same.

- When a product is scanned:
    - incriment the itemCount variable by 2.
    - display a popup that says something like, " Your count is itemCount variable, please scan more".

- This will continue until the loop detects that itemCount and targetNum are the same.

- This will break the loop and a popup box will display with the text, " Box full! Please stop scanning and move to the next box."
