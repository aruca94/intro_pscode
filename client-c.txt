### Task C: Product Package Counter

**Task:** You need to develop a program that counts the number of items that a hardware device scans to sort for boxing packages into cases. Each package scanned is two (2) products. Each case can only fit 50 product packages. Write a program that prints numbers from 2 to 50, counting by twos.

**Hint:** Loops

- create 2 variables: itemCount, and targetNum. itemCount will be assigned 0, and targetNum will be assigned 50.

- When the first product is scanned:
    - Start a loop that continually checks to see if itemCount and targetNum is the same.

- When a product is scanned:
    - incriment the itemCount variable by 2.
    - display a popup that says something like, " Your count is itemCount variable, please scan more".

- This will continue until the loop detects that itemCount and targetNum are the same.

- This will break the loop and a popup box will display with the text, " Box full! Please stop scanning and move to the next box."
